# Healthcare Symptom Checker ‚Äî Demo

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Educational demo only. This project is **not a diagnostic tool** and **not a substitute for professional medical advice**.

---

## ü©∫ Overview

This is a lightweight, single-file **Node.js + Express** application that allows users to enter symptom text and receive possible conditions with general advice and disclaimers.  
It is designed for **screening or hackathon evaluation** ‚Äî focusing on correctness, safety, code clarity, and responsible AI behavior.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

-  **Single-file deployable backend + frontend**
-  Accepts symptom input via POST request (`/check`)
-  Matches symptoms to a **limited set of common conditions**
-  Detects **red-flag emergencies** and advises immediate care
-  Displays **educational disclaimers** to ensure user safety
-  Simple HTML/CSS frontend with `fetch()` API calls
-  No external database or LLM dependency (works offline)

---

## How It Works

1. **Frontend (GET `/`)**  
   Serves a small HTML page with a textarea for symptoms and a button to check them.

2. **Backend (POST `/check`)**  
   - Accepts JSON `{ "symptoms": "<user text>" }`  
   - Checks for emergency *red-flag* keywords (e.g., "chest pain", "difficulty breathing")  
   - Matches known symptom patterns against a small set of predefined conditions  
   - Returns:
     ```json
     {
       "redFlags": ["..."],
       "possibleConditions": [
         { "name": "...", "explanation": "...", "advice": "..." }
       ],
       "disclaimers": ["..."]
     }
     ```

3. **Display**  
   The results, advice, and disclaimers are rendered dynamically in the frontend.

- ‚Äúchest pain‚Äù, ‚Äúpressure in chest‚Äù
- ‚Äúshortness of breath‚Äù, ‚Äúdifficulty breathing‚Äù
- ‚Äúsevere bleeding‚Äù
- ‚Äúloss of consciousness‚Äù
